# MuseScore Rich Presence
This MuseScore plugin allows users to showcase their current score on their Discord profile through Rich Presence integration. Information such as the score's title, author, composer, and number of measures will be displayed, providing a convenient way for others to see what you're working on and get a glimpse into your musical endeavors. With this plugin, you can easily share your musical creations with your Discord community and showcase your talents to the world.
